# QueUp
The QueUp system is designed to give Purdue ECE students and staff the ability to quickly create a queuing room, capable of handling multiple queues, and to be able to customize it to fit your class needs.

Quick start:
Generate a room code by clicking the üîÅ button.  (Room codes can only be 5 alphanumeric characters.)  Click "Create".
To join a queue, click the "+" button for a specific queue.  To leave a queue, click the button with your username on it.
Share the room code with anyone who wishes to join the queue.  They must enter the code in the "Join a room" panel.
Each room also has a description that you can customize to help users ensure they're in the right room.  

<div class="center"><video autoplay loop src="description.webm"></video></div>

You can rename the "default-queue" to whatever you wish (checkoff, help, aisle1, etc.), as well as add new queues with their own names as well.  Click the name of the queue to rename it, or click the "Add queue" button to add a new queue.

If you create a room, you are automatically the "owner" for the room, which is what lets you set the room description and add/rename queues.  If you wish to give someone else the same privileges as you, click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon, click "Add room owners", and type in a list of Purdue account usernames, separated by commas.

You can also remove owners (including yourself) by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è icon and clicking "Delete room owners", with the same input requirements.  Be sure to have at least one owner for the room - zero owners are not permitted as the room will be inaccessible.
Each room will remain open as long is there is some activity for 24 hours, after which it will be deleted.  You can also delete a room manually by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è icon and clicking "Close Room".  

As a measure of protection, non-owners cannot edit the room description or add/rename queues.
